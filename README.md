# PerfectHash
Hash function with no collisions in C

From Wikipedia: 
A perfect hash function for a set S is a hash function that maps distinct elements in S to a set of integers, with no collisions. A perfect hash function has many of the same applications as other hash functions, but with the advantage that no collision resolution has to be implemented. In mathematical terms, it is a total injective function.
